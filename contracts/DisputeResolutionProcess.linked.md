# Dispute resolution process

The process is as follows:

1. The claimant disputes the agreement on-chain.
2. Then, the Parties have [%Evidence Submission Time Window] to submit any evidence that might be needed for the Judges to resolve the dispute by proposing their desired outcome.
3. After the Evidence Submission Time Window ends, the Supreme Court Multisig has [%Outcome Proposal Time Window] to put forward their desired settlement outcome.
4. Once a settlement proposal has been put forth by the Supreme Court Multisig, any of the PartiesÂ can appeal such proposal. The time window for the appeal process is encoded in the Designated Smart Contracts.
5. A non-appealed settlement proposal will be enforceable and final, as encoded in the Designated Smart Contracts.

## Evidence submission process

For Parties to open a dispute, respond to a claim or otherwise engage with a disputed agreement, they will have to either 1) specify which means they want to be contacted through on their agreement (email, discord, telegram, etc.) or 2) else generate an Skiff Ethereum alias created by [linking their Ethereum account within Skiff](https://skiff.com/blog/ethereum-wallet-email). 

### Communicating with judges

#### Communication mechanism

The only valid communication mechanism between Parties and Judges is Skiff. Parties and Judges shall only communicate with their Skiff Ethereum alias. Unless they specify other means on their agreement.

#### Evidence submission

Any evidence to support claims or respond to them must be attached to emails within Skiff. Any evidence over 25MB will be sent using Tresorit Send. Only Parties can submit evidence related to a dispute or participate in the dispute process. Unless they specify other means on their agreement.

#### Privacy

All hearings and communications between Parties and Judges will be strictly private. No other parties shall be included in the hearings or communications between Parties and Judges. No private communications between Parties and Judges shall be released to the public or anyone else outside those groups.

Hearings or communications shall be public, and the above shall not apply, if the case involves the dismissal of a Judge from the Supreme Court Multisig.

In case of a Judge being dismissed, Parties and Judges shall, within the next 7 days, exclude such Judge from all future communications related to the dispute.

Failure to comply with these privacy rules will result in the infringing party being ruled entirely liable for the maximum possible amount of losses within the agreement.

The Supreme Court Multisig might decide to publish anonymized data about the case, if such action would be in the interest of morals, public order, the security of Nation3 or the interests of the parties and witnesses. No data shall be published that cannot be effectively anonymized.

#### Platform malfunction

In case of a malfunction within Skiff, the Supreme Court Multisig will post a joint statement declaring the use of Ethermail instead of Skiff. All Parties and Judges shall continue adhering to the same procedures detailed for Skiff, but instead of using their Skiff Ethereum alias, they must use their Ethermail address.
